<h3 id="about-me">About Me</h3>
<p>Hello I’m Richard Obregon, but everyone I know calls me Ricky! My family’s taught me to be a very determined and resilient individual, and these are traits that I try to pass on to every student who I have the pleasure to work with. I’m currently enrolled at UC Davis and the plan is to acquire a PHD in the Biomedical Engineering field some day soon. I know the value of acquiring a higher education and I thoroughly enjoy guiding students on their path towards acquiring one as well. Everytime I witness a student comprehend a difficult concept they had trouble with, I get just as excited as they do! I take pride in my work ethic, my high morals and my ability to self-motivate. It is because of these factors that I’ve acquired not only high quality grades in school, but high quality relationships as well. I love the idea of not only being a tutor, but a mentor for life in general as well!</p>
