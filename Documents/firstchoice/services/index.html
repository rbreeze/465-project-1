<h3 id="the-future-is-here">The Future is Here.</h3>
<p>Do you live hours away from Folsom, CA? Do you live close by but you’d prefer not to drive? Not a problem! Gone are the days of needing to travel 30 minutes to meet with a high quality tutor, or having to settle for what’s around. The students we tutor all across the country choose to work with us on a weekly basis because we still manage to keep the personal experience associated with working together in-person. Students regularly mention how they feel like they’re working side by side with a tutor even though they’re many miles apart!</p>

<h3 id="how-it-all-works">How it all works</h3>
<p>A day or two before tutoring takes place, either the student or the parent sends material for the session in advance. This can be done either by phone or email, and the material can range from pictures of handouts or returned exams, to pictures of pages from a textbook. There’s no limit to what can be sent, and the more material that we receive the better. And that’s pretty much it! Once we have the information, our tutors will refer to it as necessary to ensure the same top quality tutoring experience. Our academic mentors have all the necessary equipment needed to write out problems and draw diagrams (see slideshow above). No special equipment is needed from the student! Still not convinced? Check out the benefits of online tutoring below, as well as what current students and parents have to say about  working with us through Skype!</p>

<h3 id="benefits-of-skype">Benefits of Skype</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Convenience</strong> - Zero commute for the parent and student. No more needing to drive 30 minutes round trip for a 60 minute session.</li>
  <li><strong>Comfort</strong> - The student can tutor from home (or dorm room) in a quiet environment free from distractions that can occur in busy locations such a coffee shop or public library.</li>
  <li><strong>Availability</strong> - To the many families we work with (and will work with) who live more than an hour away, geography is no longer a restriction. Finding a local tutor experienced in a particular subject can be a hassle, and it is now a thing of the past. Discovering the right tutor for your needs has suddenly become a lot easier with Skype!</li>
  <li><strong>Technology Advantages</strong> - Whether the advantage is color coordinating (which help with the understanding of complicated concepts) or being able to take a screenshot of the computer screen (essentially having a copy of the tutor’s notes for later review), tutoring through the internet has many advantages and valuable tools which help in the learning process.</li>

<h2 id="sat--act-test-prep">SAT &amp; ACT Test Prep</h2>
<h3 id="preparation">Preparation</h3>

<p><strong>“The essence of training is to allow error without consequence.” - Orson Scott Card</strong></p>

<p>The SAT and ACT  are two exams that are widely used for college admissions here in the United States. And they are unlike any typical exam you will take in high school. At First Choice Tutoring, your student will receive the help that he or she needs to maximize their potential and get the highest possible score!<br />
​
We offer test preparation in either a one-on-one or small group format. Our test prep programs are customized for every student we work with. So whether you’re a student who has not taken the SAT or ACT test before, or if you’re looking to improve an existing score, we have a prepared course of action that’s perfect for you!</p>

<p>Click <a href="/assets/Test-Differences.pdf">here</a> for an informational page on the SAT vs. the ACT.</p>

<h3 id="benefits-of-sat--act-test-prep">Benefits of SAT / ACT Test Prep</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Gaining A Competitive Edge</strong> - The US Dept. of Education has stated that the average number of application colleges have received  has increased by 60% from 2002 to 2011, and this number will most likely continue to rise. Our personalized test prep is an excellent way for your child to acquire knowledge that will put them ahead of the competition.</li>
  <li><strong>College Scholarships</strong> - There are many college sholarships out there that are out of reach to students who don’t have a high enough SAT or ACT test score(the National Merit Scholarship for example). By incorporating Test Prep into the process, you can dramatically increase your chances of acquiring some of these elusive scholarships.</li>
  <li><strong>Increase In Confidence</strong> - Knowing the topics on either exam isn’t enough. Many students who take the exam for the first time without proper preparation can easily be overwhelmed and freeze up because they aren’t accustomed to the format. Knowing what to expect and being familiar with the exam ahead of time will lower test anxiety and help improve a student’s score.</li>
